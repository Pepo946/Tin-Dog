### What I learned

First Html i just know from now how to make in icons for my Web site and how to use section in good way 

```html
<link rel="icon" href="./images/OIP.66m_SqV5aESg-P0KFtExyQHaEK">
<a href="#title" class="nav-link active" aria-current="page"> + <section id="title">

```

Bootstrap
```html
<div class="container mb-5 ">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12">
 </div>               
<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3 mt-3 text-center">
<div class="container col-xxl-8 px-4 pt-5">
    <ul class="list-unstyled mt-3 mb-4">
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('Yayyyyyy , thank you for visiting ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

My future PLans is to be more good in Web-Dev{Using htnl and css and bootstrap and why not js to  }
